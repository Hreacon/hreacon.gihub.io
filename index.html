              <p>
                My name is Nicholas Jensen-Hay. The hyphenated name is from unmarried parents, and it doesn't bother me that I spent most of my childhood with only my Mother. In fact, I think it made me <em>stronger</em>. I spent the 90's growing up, and in kindergarden my teacher predicted that I would have a career doing something with computers.
              </p>
              <p>
                I started a computer troubleshooting and repair business while I was still in high school. I left high school <em>early</em> to attend college, and my business had to take a back seat. I attended Southern Oregon University for a few years until the college started loosing money and laid off good, but not tenured, teachers. It was when they awarded the dean over $100,000 to remodel the deans house that I decided to leave, and follow my mother to Portland because she transferred jobs.
              </p>
              <p>
                My first few years in Portland didn't go very well. I had a few jobs, but nothing good or computer related. Looking back, it was as if I were wandering in the dark ages. Finally having steady work, I put more time into meeting a girl. Accomplishments were made in this category, and we fell in love. A year into steady employment, my employer had promised me vacation time. A perfect opportunity to spend some quality time with my new love, I heartily applied for my vacation.
              </p>
              <p>
                Within a few days my supervisor showed up with my replacement and that was that. To make my car payments, among other bills, I did odd jobs. This sometimes involved helping people with their computer, but there is a daunting amount of competition in the big city to start a business. After many months of temp work, odd jobs, and doing whatever I could to live through the depression, I found steady work at an envelope factory.
              </p>
              <p>
                Working in a factory paid decently, and I was good at it, but it never felt like what I wanted. Almost four years go by without much progress towards my career, but I did manage to buy a home. Eventually I sarted hating my job, started creating a shift in my reality. Finally I found my way out of enveopes and into <strong>Epicodus</strong>.
              </p>
              <p>
                This starts my current chapter in life. <strong>Epicodus</strong> has been a great environment so far. Being around ohers that are learning and growing all day is wonderful. I strive to do my best and help my fellow classmates as much as I can, and we shall see what the future brings.
